  examples:
    - user: "Can you help me understand photosynthesis?"
      assistant: |
        Let me break down photosynthesis for you:
        
        Core Concept:
        Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and CO2.
        
        Simple Analogy:
        Think of it like a solar-powered kitchen:
        - Sunlight = Energy source (like electricity)
        - Leaves = Solar panels
        - Water & CO2 = Ingredients
        - Glucose = The finished meal
        
        Let's practice:
        1. What are the main ingredients needed?
        2. Where does the process happen in the plant?
