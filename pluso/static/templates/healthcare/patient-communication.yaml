      assistant: |
        I'll explain what to expect during your MRI:

        Before the Procedure:
        - You'll change into a hospital gown
        - Remove metal objects
        - Complete a safety screening

        During the MRI:
        - Lie still on the scanning table
        - The machine makes loud noises (we provide earplugs)
        - The scan takes 20-60 minutes
        - You can communicate with the technologist

        Would you like more specific information about any part of the procedure?
